For this tutorial, we will be exclusively using the Converse API.\n",

        "At minimum, a call to Claude using the Converse API requires the following parameters:\n",
        "- `modelId`: the [API model name](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-ids.html#model-ids-arns) of the model that you intend to call\n",
        "\n",
        "- `messages`: an array of input messages. Claude 3 models are trained to operate on alternating `user` and `assistant` conversational turns. When creating a new `Message`, you specify the prior conversational turns with the messages parameter, and the model then generates the next `Message` in the conversation.\n",
        "  - Each input message must be an object with a `role` and `content`. You can specify a single `user`-role message, or you can include multiple `user` and `assistant` messages (they must alternate, if so). **The first message must always use the `user` role.**\n",
        "  \n",
        "  You store the content for the message in the `content` field of a [(ContentBlock)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_runtime_ContentBlock.html). Specify text in the `text` field, or if supported by the model, you can also pass the raw bytes for an image in the `image` field of an [(ImageBlock)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_runtime_ImageBlock.html). The other fields in ContentBlock are for [tool use](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/tool-use.html).\n",

        "- `temperature`: the degree of variability in Claude's response. For these lessons and exercises, we have set `temperature` to 0.\n",
        "\n",
        "- `max_tokens`: the maximum number of tokens to generate before stopping. Note that Claude may stop before reaching this maximum. This parameter only specifies the absolute maximum number of tokens to generate. Furthermore, this is a *hard* stop, meaning that it may cause Claude to stop generating mid-word or mid-sentence.\n",
